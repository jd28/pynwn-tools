### ErfEd v0.1

ErfEd is a clone of Bioware's nwhak.exe written with Python and PyQT.

It has a few nice additional features:
* Filtering list by Unix file wildcards and/or resource type.
* Dragging and Dropping files, rather than an 'Add file' menu.
* Expanded recent files list.
* Typical loads ERFs much faster.

As far as I know there is only one regression: sorting resources lists
of monster HAKs like LoW's seasonal tileset is slower.
